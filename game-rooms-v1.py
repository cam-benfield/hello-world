outside = ["""You awaken in a clearing.
What appears to be a Polynesian home stretches out before you.
You come upon a grey wooden door
with a tiki carved in the front of it.
A small POND is to your right.
Do you OPEN the door or LEAVE?"""]

entryway = ["""
You enter a dark room with an ARCH to your right.
In the arch, you hear the whirring of profane rituals
intended to reveal the future.
Along the wall just ahead,
there is an ALTAR to the gods of the land.
To your left, there is a TABLE surrounded by shelves
upon shelves of small armies, intended to bring success in war.
Just ahead, you see a HALLWAY that leads into darkness.
Where would you like to go?

office = ["""
The whirring that was heard upon entering gets louder.
You see a wooden box glowing in the distance.
As an offering to the box, there is a small DRUM
in a circle on the floor.
You inspect the room and find nothing else of consequence.
Ahead, you see a hallway that seems to lead to another room.
Do you go FORWARD or BACK?
